    tr35: "Frequently Asked Questions",
    tr36: "What is Open Transfer ?",
    tr37: `
      Open Transfer is a standalone mobile application 
      designed to exempt citizens being under a network 
      operator to manually enter codes USSD to carry out 
      their daily tasks in offering them a digital 
      solution with the aim of to automate the 
      composition and launch of USSD codes.
    `,
    tr38: "Who are our targets ?",
    tr39: `
      Open Transfer is available to citizens with a more 
      modern mobile phone (Smart phone, Android, Infinix, 
      Itel, etc...) and using at least one of the 
      following network operators: MTN or MOOV.
    `,
    tr40: "Why create such a service ?",
    tr41: `
      Following numerous studies and interviews on the subject,
      it is clear that :<br/><br/>
      The user must remember the associated code to the 
      operation he wishes to carry out. That represents a 
      handicap for old people or those approaching old age, 
      without forgot that USSD codes can be changed at any 
      time what time, thus penalizing the user who already 
      accustomed to using the old codes. It is still worse 
      for people who are not very present on the network 
      operators.<br/><br/>
      The user gets tired quickly due to the number and the 
      breathtaking length of USSD codes to compose without 
      mentioning typing errors during the composition as well 
      as those of the network at times or at given periods, 
      thus forcing the latter to recompose the code over and 
      over again. This is annoying to the user especially 
      since it wastes his time unnecessarily.<br/><br/>
      Operators attempted to resolve the issue by providing 
      their customers with a application imbued with their 
      services. The problem is that these apps are clean and 
      centered only on their network, thus forcing the end 
      user to download and install as many applications as
      networks he would like to use. The latter must therefore 
      have an application over network unnecessarily overloading 
      the storage memory of your device while knowing that all 
      these same applications have services in common.
    `,
    tr42: "How it works ?",
    tr43: `
      Open Transfer provides instead of built-in Sorbre terminal
      to the device's operating system, an interface easy to use 
      and intuitive, significantly reducing the probabilities of 
      making entry errors and again less, to get the wrong 
      recipient. In the background, the USSD codes are 
      automatically dialed for you by depending on the 
      operation to be performed and the network operator
      selected.
    `,
    tr44: `
      Do we necessarily have to activate mobile data to
      use Open Transfer ?
    `,
    tr45: `
      Open Transfer does not need mobile data, nor internet 
      by the way. This application can also be used well 
      both online and offline. She stays accessible at any 
      time regardless of your network conditions.
    `,
    tr46: "Can we do inter-network transfers ?",
    tr47: `
      Although the possibility of making transfers
      money between different network operators
      would be an interesting feature to integrate,
      However, Open Transfer does not yet support
      such functionality.
    `,
    tr48: `
      Do we have to create an account on Open Transfer
      before its use ?
    `,
    tr49: `
      Open Transfer was originally created to assist you
      and help you in your daily operations with your
      network operators. You do not need to create a
      rely on it and even less to authenticate
      before any use.
    `,
    tr50: "Is Open Transfer free ?",
    tr51: `
      Open Transfer is just a simple tool. Apart from the costs 
      basic requirements imposed by your usual network operators, 
      no additional charges are levied, whether on your payments, 
      purchases, etc... In other words, it's 100% free from 
      download to consumption of all services provided.
    `,
    tr52: "How does Open Transfer manage the storage of our data ?",
    tr53: `
      Open Transfer does not collect any information from
      of the user. Whether it is very personal or not. On 
      the other hand, it uses the storage memory of the 
      device to store the different configurations from 
      updates made to the application as well that the 
      options frequently used by the user in order to 
      provide them with an experience adapted to these 
      preferences.
    `,
    tr54: `
      Why is my password required for most of the operations 
      I perform ?
    `,
    tr55: `
      As you can see, Open Transfer does not save not your 
      password. It is done this way for reasons safety while 
      taking care of the conditions and operating mode of 
      Open Transfer without forgetting the real-time use cases.
    `,
    tr56: "My operation is not working. What should I do ?",
    tr57: `
      Generally, when there is a problem, Open Transfer specifies 
      the cause(s) of the error that occurred and gives basic 
      guidelines to remedy this. However, if you want to do 
      an operation and it doesnâ€™t work, here is what could be 
      causing the error :<br/>
      - Your operator's network is unstable or present 
      tubulences. In these cases, either you try with a 
      another network operator, or you wait in order to 
      try again later.<br/><br/>
      - The second cause could be due to a wrong USSD code 
      generated by Open Transfer in the background. In this 
      case, it is recommended to update the application in 
      order to benefit from new configurations and changes 
      made on the latter. The bad code hypothesis is due to 
      the change thereof within your operator network.<br/><br/>
      - Your sim is too old; has been taken out of service 
      or blocked by your own network operator. In this case
      figure, it is strongly recommended to change your 
      sim card to another more recent one from your 
      network operator.
    `,
    tr58: "What is the QR code used for ?",
    tr59: `
      Open Transfer gives you the option to be the recipient 
      or to refer a recipient of a transfer agreed between 
      you and your transmitter. This can be a money transfer 
      For example. The QR code, once generated, exempts you 
      from each time given the same telephone number before 
      receive a transfer on that.
    `,
    tr60: "Can we make inter-country transfers ?",
    tr61: `
      Just like inter-operator transfer, Open Transfer does not 
      does not support inter-country transfers. Even less to be 
      the recipient of payments from countries stranger. This 
      feature is not available for now.
    `,
    tr62: "Does Open Transfer extend to merchant sims ?",
    tr63: `
      Unfortunately, Open Transfer does not support still 
      merchant sims. She can't stand that sims intended 
      for customer use for the moment.
    `,
    tr64: `
      An error occurred while sending your message. This may 
      be due to flow instability of your network. Make sure 
      you have a connection stable then try again.
